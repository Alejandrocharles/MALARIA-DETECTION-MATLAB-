# MALARIA-DETECTION-MATLAB-
This project uses MATLAB to simulate an electric field for malaria detection. It is based on physical calculations to perform the detection.

## Description

The project consists of a main function called `electric_field_simulation`. This function creates a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to initiate an electric field simulation. Users can adjust the rod length and the number of points in the grid and the number of charges.

The simulation is performed by calculating the electric field generated by charges on a rod. The electric field is then drawn, and the charges are displayed on the GUI. The unique aspect of this simulation is its application in detecting malignant cells, such as those found in malaria. By simulating the electric field interactions, we can identify areas of concern and potentially detect the presence of disease.

## How to Use

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the directory of the cloned repository.
3. Run the `electric_field_simulation` function in the MATLAB command window.
4. Adjust the parameters as needed and click "Start Simulation".
